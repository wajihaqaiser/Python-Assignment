    "### 1- Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another."

When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.From a programming point of view, an object can be a data structure, a variable or a function. It has a memory location allocated. The object is designed as class hierarchies."
